- 👋 Hi, I’m @m00se-v1
- 👀 I’m interested in C# and VB.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make WPF applications using C# and VB as well as write programs to utilize RF testing equipment.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that send commands to external sources (i.e. RF test equipment, temperature controllers) or beginner projects. Anything to help build my software development skills, really.
- 📫 I can best be reached at my personal email: mendozamosses5@gmail.com
